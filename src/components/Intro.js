      The 4C Mortality Score and 4C Deterioration models are risk stratification
      tools that predict in-hospital mortality or in-hospital clinical
      deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or
      critical care, or death) for hospitalised COVID-19 patients, produced by
      the <a href="https://isaric4c.net/">ISARIC4C consortium</a>.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scores are intended to be considered only by clinicians to aid their
      clinical decision-making, however clinicians should ultimately rely on
      their own clinical judgement in treatment decisions. In compliance with
      the Medical Devices Regulations 2002, the raw data generating the Scores
      and look up table to estimate mortality and probability of deterioration
      are provided for the clinician to review and as such this webpage is not
      considered to be a medical device.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are designed to require only parameters that are commonly available
      at hospital presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Predictors should be measured at the point of hospital presentation for
      suspected community-acquired cases, or first evaluation for COVID-19 for
      suspected nosocomial cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are based on a large UK cohort of patients, and should not be adopted
      for routine clinical use in other settings until they have been
      appropriately validated for these settings.
