      The 4C Mortality Score and 4C Deterioration models are risk stratification
      tools that predict in-hospital mortality or in-hospital clinical
      deterioration (defined as any requirement of ventilatory support or
      critical care, or death) for hospitalised COVID-19 patients, produced by
      the <a href="https://isaric4c.net/">ISARIC4C consortium</a>.{" "}
      <b>They are intended for use by clinicians.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      They are designed to require only parameters that are commonly available
      at hospital presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are based on a large UK cohort of patients, and should not be adopted
      for routine clinical use in other settings until they have been
      appropriately validated for these settings.
